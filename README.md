# Hachimichi_Task <br />
Task A- Retrieve Images and show them Recycler, It will loaded on every 5th second.One can also Upload Images and then see them in Recycler View. <br />
<br/>
In this task , i was asked to add Images in Image slider which can done easily bu using View Flipper and passing a string of images through it's ImageViews.But, here is used Recycler View and loaded pictures in that, because i thought that i should show skills in difficult task. There is no in-built method for recyclerView interval sroll So, i used handler, Runnablr and geCount methods to implement that.
<br/>
Also, i added one additonal features (Not asked), i added Upload Image Activity , from where one can Upload Images to Firebase Storage and Database.<br/>
<br/>
Task-B It demonstrate the use of different inbuilt sensors of android device and shows their basic infromation.<br/>
Here also i added two activities, one which tells the total availbale Sensors in the device and the other one wherr you can the listener of most important one's out of them<br/>
<br/>
I have tried to improve the Design as much as i can, I have used some themes from your Website and also added yourlogo as App logo.
